# GenBase

** THIS REPO IS IN DEVELOPMENT **

GenBase powers the base needs of [Genesis](https://www.studiopress.com/features/) child themes.  This API seeks to minimize the work needed to build custom themes.

You install GenBase within your Genesis child theme.  And then follow the instructions.

[Kickoff](https://github.com/hellofromtonya/kickoff) is a developer-empowered starter theme.  Use it as your example guide.

## Features

- Core styles in Sass that are fully configurable from the theme.
- Gulp backed right into it to handle the compiling, linting, and optimizing tasks.
- Asset management and version handlers.
- Theme initialization and setup via configuration.
- Extended features.
